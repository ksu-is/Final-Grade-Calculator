 1. [x] Develop a menu function that takes an input to call other functions in the calculator and outputs current grade with weight included
 1. [x] Create a function that calculates a grade category
    1. [x] Ask the user the weight,number of assignments, and the scores of each assignment 
    1. [x] Force function to only take digits and not letters
    1. [x] organize given information into variables
    1. [x] calculate grade for category by adding the scores of each assignment, dividing them by the total amount, and then multiplying the weight
    1. [x] Ensure it outputs the correct grade
  1. [x] Duplicate and adjust the grade category calculator to other categories (ex:quizzes, test, assignments)
  1. [x] Print the grade on the menu
      1. [x] Make the final grade local variables in the funtions global so that they can be referenced in another function like menu
  1. [x] Create a custom category to to make the calculator more flexible
      1. [x] create another function within the custom function(named customs) that takes different parameters(ex:name,weight,number assignments in category)
      1. [x] Ask user the number of custom category they would like to add
      1. [x] call the customs and append information to a list
  1. [x] Create an option on the menu to display custom category details since the menu will only show the average of all custom categories together instead individually
  1. [ ] Instead of averaging all the custom categories together, create a function that displays them individually
  1. [x] Create what if statements to detect which categories the user used to calculate final grade
  1. [ ] Continue to run and test for code to search for errors or crashes
  1. [ ] Update the readme as changes occur
