 1. [] Develop a menu function that takes an input to call other functions in the calculator and outputs current grade with weight included
 1. [] Create a function that calculates a grade category
    1. [] Ask the user the weight,number of assignments, and the scores of each assignment 
    1. [] Force function to only take digits and not letters
    1. [] organize given information into variables
    1. [] calculate grade for category by adding the scores of each assignment, dividing them by the total amount, and then multiplying the weight
    1. [] Ensure it outputs the correct grade
  1. [] Duplicate and adjust the grade category calculator to other categories (ex:quizzes, test, assignments)
  1. [] Print the grade on the menu
      1. [] Make the final grade local variables in the funtions global so that they can be referenced in another function like menu
  1. [] Create a custom category to to make the calculator more flexible
      1. [] create another function within the custom function(named customs) that takes different parameters(ex:name,weight,number assignments in category)
      1. [] Ask user the number of custom category they would like to add
      1. [] call the customs and append information to a list
  1. [] Create an option on the menu to display custom category details since the menu will only show the average of all custom categories together instead individually
  1. [] Continue to run and test for code to search for errors or crashes
  1. [] Update the readme as changes occur
